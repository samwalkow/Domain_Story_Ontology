# Domain_Story_Ontology

My Spring 2020 Research Practicum project. I created an ontology from user narratives called domain stories. I gathered three domain stories from the computational astrophysics domain. From these narratives, I identified common themes and attempted to organized common elements into classes and to map the relationships between these classes.

## Domain stories

The three domain stories had very similar themes in both the steps they took and the order of those steps. Users drew their computational workflow on paper or virtually, and we iterated over the process three or four times. Information in the form of pseudocode, metadata, task repetition, and additional details were added with iteration. Learning about what users where thinking at each stage, and why they took the steps they did was the focus. This was also the hardest thing for people to articulate.

## Analysis

I put the drawings side by side and circled what was similar or the same. Whole pieces of the narratives overlapped. I also typed out the stories into numbered steps, and bolded what was the same. These common theme will be mapped in an ontology.

## Ontology

I put the common elements into classes, the relationships into object properties, and the attributes into data properties using the web Protege tool (https://webprotege.stanford.edu/#login) and VOWL visualization tool (http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/).

The visualization is here: http://www.visualdataweb.de/webvowl/#file=DFHF1aLb7Hz87Qnysf4TRA.owl

By mapping common computation elements to each other, I hope to create high level programming language to be used for data visualization and analysis.

## Future Directions

I'd like to use context free grammar to translate the ontology classes to a common vocabulary with rules. From there, I'd like to turn the context free grammar results into a program in python.

## What is Information Presentation

I presented this work at the 2020 What is Information Virtual Conference.
